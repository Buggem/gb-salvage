    <title>GameBoy Color Developer's Tools</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>GameBoy Developer's Tools</h1>
This is a group of tools for building and testing programs for the 
Gameboy Color on a windows PC.  The tools included are:
<h2>SDCC-9.0</h2>
This is a modified version of the Small Device C Compiler
available <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdcc />here</a>.
This package differs from the SDCC official release in the following:
<ul>
<li>Compiler/linker modified to support ROM bank switching on the GBZ80.  I've
only included those files necessary to (re) build the compiler and libraries
for the GBZ80</li>
<li>Runtime library considerably modified.  Floating point has been 
(re)implemented in assembler for the GBZ80.  It is much, much smaller and faster
than the original C language version.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameboy Developer's kit by Pascal Felber</h2>
Several people have contributed enhancements to this kit.  I've made a number of changes
which I found necessary.  But most of the work is due to previous contributors</li>
<h2>Examples of small applications built with these tools</h2>
<h2>Db2gb</h2>
This windows program used for creating gameboy graphics.
To use this program:
<ol>
<li>Create *.bmp files using microsoft paint or similar program.  These
bit maps should be a multiple of 8 bits wide and high</li>
<li>Open all the *.bmp file with Db2gb.  This can be done by the file open 
command.  But it's usually much easier to select a whole group of files
with windows explorer and drop them onto Db2bgb icon or open application.</li>
<li>Now should be able to see all your bit maps.  You select window/tile 
to make them all visible at once.</li>
<li>Use File/Save All to create Gameboy C code files for all these 
bitmaps.  The tile data is shared among all the bit maps.  There
is a tile map which contains all the icons and finally a table
of indices into the tile map for each icon.  The makes the most
efficient usage of the gameboy tiling scheme.</li>
</ol>
<h2>VGBC - Virtual Gamboy Color by Rusty Wagner</h2>
I've found this to be indispensible for testing and debugging gameboy
programs.
<h2>GSound</h2>
All you every wanted to know about gameboy sound setup.
<h2>Music</h2>
I found this program indispensble for experimenting with gameboy
sound to get the sounds I want.  Once I had them, I could use the
parameters in my code and get the same sounds.

<script type="text/javascript">
  var _gaq = _gaq || [];
  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-2487077-1']);
  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);

  (function() {
    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text/javascript'; ga.async = true;
    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ? 'https://ssl' : 'http://www') + '.google-analytics.com/ga.js';
    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(ga);
  })();
</script>
