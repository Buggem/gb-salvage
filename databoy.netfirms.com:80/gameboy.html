									<p><font size="+1">Game Boy is a popular hand-held video game console made by Nintendo, with a proven track record for durability and reliability. </font><font size="+1">Several models have appeared over the years. </font></p>
									<ul>
										<li><font size="+1">1989. The original Game Boy (GB), also known as Game Boy Classic, has a 4 mHz, 8-bit CPU, a 160 x 144 dot matrix monochrome LCD display, graphics controller, sound generator, 8 KB of user RAM, and a simple keypad.</font>
										<li><font size="+1">1996. Game Boy Pocket (GBP) is slimmer, but functionally identical to Game Boy Classic with an improved monochrome LCD display. </font>
										<li><font size="+1">1999. Game Boy Color (GBC) is roughly the same shape and size as GBP but with some significant improvements. The CPU can run at 8 mHz, user RAM has been increased to 32 KB, an infrared port has been added, and the screen has been upgraded to a color LCD. GBC is backward compatible with GB/GBP (i.e. it can play old game cartridges).</font>
										<li><font size="+1">2001. Game Boy Advance (GBA) is about the same size as GBC turned on its side. GBA has a larger screen with improved graphics, a 16 mHz, 32-bit CPU, and 288 KB of user RAM. These enhancements, however, come into play only when a new GBA cartridge is inserted. With an old cartridge, GBA runs in GBC compatibility mode and performs exactly like a GBC, thereby providing backward compatibility with older cartridges.</font>
										<li><font size="+1">2003. Game Boy Advance SP (GBASP) is a repackaged version of GBA. GBASP is functionally identical to GBA, but with a front-lit, fold-up screen and a rechargeable battery.</font>
										<li><font size="+1">2005. Game Boy Micro (GBM) has many features of Game Boy Advance SP, but in a smaller package.  One important difference is that GBM is not compatible with GB/GBC cartridges.</font>
									</ul>
									<p><font size="+1">These features, combined with low price and widespread availability, make Game Boy an ideal platform for many non-game applications. Furthermore, Game Boy's rugged construction makes it well-suited for harsh environments where other hand-held computers might not survive for long. Thus, it is not surprising that a number of developers and hobbyists have used Game Boy in ways perhaps not envisioned by its designers. Below is a partial list of a few products and projects involving Game Boy.</font></p>
									<ul>
										<li><font size="+1">Electrocardiogram unit (US patent #5876351)</font>
										<li><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.theapplecollection.com/iMac/iStore/Singer-IZEK.html">Izek Sewing machine controller by Singer</a></font>
										<li><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.gamersgraveyard.com/repository/gameboy/peripherals/pocketsonar.html">Pocket Sonar for fishing by Bandai</a></font>
										<li><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.semis.demon.co.uk/Gameboy/DsoDemo/DsoDemo.htm">Digital sampling oscilloscope </a></font>
										<li><font size="+1"><a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/kookie">GPS unit </a></font>
										<li><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.retrothing.com/2006/04/songpro_mp3_pla.html">MP3 player </a></font>
										<li><font size="+1"><a href="http://www.educatingmario.com/index.htm">Captigate- an educational product also useful for hobbyists</a></font>
									</ul>
									<p><font size="+1">DataBoy has been designed to run on all Game Boy models, except Game Boy Micro. However, the DataBoy software takes advantage of GBC's more advanced graphics capabilities and higher CPU speed, and will therefore not run properly on GB/GBP. </font></p>
