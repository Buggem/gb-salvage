In Spring 2006,<em>CRATEL</em>headed a course called <a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081121180836/http://wikihost.org/wikis/techartsound/">Technology: Art and Sound by Design</a>. In this course, Artists and Engineers collaborated to build original interactive artwork.<em>CRATEL</em>also sponsors <!--<a class="http_dead" href="http://www.wichita.edu/iradio">WSUiR: WSU's Student-run Internet Radio station</a>--><!--<a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060904155101/http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=iradio&p=/index">WSUiR: WSU's Student-run Internet Radio station</a>--><a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080103214534/http://wsuir.wichita.edu:80/">WSUiR: WSU's Student-run Internet Radio station</a>. Students from across the university are currently working with <em>CRATEL</em> to structure <em>WSUiR</em> to use Internet streaming technology to connect WSU with the world and the world with WSU through local, live, and multicultural events. In Spring 2006 WSU hosted <!--<a class="http_dead" href="http://www.wichita.edu/beta">CRATEL's first annual BETA Competition</a>--><a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080124113115/http://webs.wichita.edu/?u=BETA&p=/index/">CRATEL's first annual BETA Competition</a>. BETA: Bridging Entrepreneurship, Technology, and the Arts is a university-wide competition awarding $7,000 in prizes for the best entrepreneurial idea which connects the arts with technology. <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span></p><p class="line867"><em>CRATEL</em> is also sponsoring development of a <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070906174010/http://cratel.wichita.edu/cratel/Video_Synthesizer">video synthesizer</a>, and is currently facilitating communication between Electrical Engineers, Computer Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Musicians, and Visual Artists to innovate within this domain. We also teach a course called <a class="wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070714060052/http://cratel.wichita.edu/cratel/iss_home">Introduction to Sound Synthesis</a>. <em>Introduction to Sound Synthesis</em> combines the disciplines of the  arts, engineering, computer science and mathematicians to explore how synthesizers work and how to create new and unique synthesized sounds. <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span></p><p class="line862">In fall 2006 <em>CRATEL</em> launched <em>Strings, Kansas!</em> A distance-learning-enhanced program, <em>Strings, Kansas!</em> connects WSU School of Music students with 4th and 5th graders in communities without string programs through distance learning technology. Sponsored in part by <a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080514211028/http://www.carnegiehall.org/article/explore_and_learn/ovr_weill_music_inst.html">The Weill Music Institute at Carnegie Hall</a>, <em>Strings, Kansas!</em> is based on the premise that active communication between these Kansan communities and WSU's thriving music community will provide inspiration and motivation to support music for youth throughout our state. <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span></p><p class="line867"><em>CRATEL</em> is founded on my belief that technology can be an integral part of espressivity in the arts and in culture.
