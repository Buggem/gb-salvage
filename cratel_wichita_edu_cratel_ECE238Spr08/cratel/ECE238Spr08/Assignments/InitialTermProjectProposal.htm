<span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><ul><li>describe fully what your application will do. For example, "I am going to write a shooting game" is not enough. Instead describe the shooting game. For example: <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><ul><li>How do the various ships move? <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span></li><li>What sort of logic will be necessary? <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></li><li>Can you describe some of the logic involved? <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span></li><li>How does your code break up into significant sections? <span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><ul><li>Can you describe these sections <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span></li><li>How will these sections interact with each other <span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span></li></ul></li><li><p class="line862">Are the enemy ships from the planet Zerba or the planet Zalba? <em>very important.</em> <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span></p></li></ul></li><li>describe what tools you will need (map builder, mod tracker, etc.) <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span></li><li>describe both what you already know how to do and what you do not know how to do <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

For example "I will know how to program the ship movements" is not an acceptable milestone. Instead "I will post to the class blog my code which controls the ship movements as I want them in the game" is better. <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><ul><li>A good submission will be at least several paragraphs. If yours is less, look to add more specifics of how you are going to do what you propose to do and what milestones you might add to your project. <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span></li><li>You can propose to work as a team of 2 people on the same project, but I am not encouraging this. If you do propose to work together: <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><ul><li>Make sure you outline how the responsibilities on the team will be divided. <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span></li><li>Know that I will still grade you individually on the project based on the quality I perceive your individual work to be. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span></li><li>Have a plan from the beginning for how each of you will document your work so it is clear what each of you have contributed. <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span></li></ul></li><li>This is considered an initial exploration of what you will do. The finished idea, accepted by me, is not due until March 31. Therefore: <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><ul><li>Feel free to speculate more freely on what you'd really like to do. We can refine later. <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span></li><li>You are encouraged to comment on each other's submissions, suggest ideas to each other, etc. <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span></li></ul></li><li><p class="line891"><strong>I must approve all project proposals before they will be accepted as projects.</strong>  <span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span></p></li></ul><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div><p id="pageinfo" class="info" lang="en" dir="ltr">ECE238Spr08/Assignments/InitialTermProjectProposal  (last edited 2010-08-04 16:50:47 by <span title="??? @ localhost[127.0.0.1]">localhost</span>)</p>
