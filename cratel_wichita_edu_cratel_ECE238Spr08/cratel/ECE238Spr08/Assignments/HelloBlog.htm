<span class="anchor" id="line-2"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">Create a blog account and post your home page to the <a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090606133145/http://cratel.wichita.edu/blogs/Assembly08">Assembly language class blog</a> or <a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100708093742/http://cratel.wichita.edu/blogs/tasd2008/">TASD class blog</a>, depending on which class you are in. <span class="anchor" id="line-3"></span></p></li><li>Due February 4 midnight before class <span class="anchor" id="line-4"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"></p><hr><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><ul><li><p class="line891">WordPress, the engine CRATEL uses for blogging, is a multiuser/multiblog system. That means one user can have multiple blogs and one blog can have multiple users. <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span></p></li><li><p class="line862">For this course, you will have the ability to post on 2 blogs, one blog is your own personal blog and you will be the only user. The other is the class main blog (<a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090606133145/http://cratel.wichita.edu/blogs/Assembly08">Assembly language</a> or <a class="http_wayback" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100708093742/http://cratel.wichita.edu/blogs/tasd2008/">TASD</a>) and all the members of the class will be users on this blog. <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span></p></li><li>You are not required to use your own blog for this class, only the class blog. However, since it is easy and free, you might as well create it. I suggest you use your personal blog as a "sketchbook" where you can take notes about your work for the class. <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span></li><li>You are the supreme being (administrator) of your personal blog. This means that you can activate blog plugins (for spam prevention or to play audio files, for example), add users, etc. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span></li><li>The course instructors are the supreme beings of the Assembly Language and TASD course blogs. This means that one of them has to add you as a user before you can complete the assignment. They can do this only after you have created a user account on the CRATEL blogs. <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">
