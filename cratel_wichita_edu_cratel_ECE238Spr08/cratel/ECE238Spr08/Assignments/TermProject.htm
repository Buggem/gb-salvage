<span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line862">This assignment serves as a record for your work in the class and will be the most likely resource used by future members of the class and the intergalactic GameBoy programming community at large. I will go over each of these assignments carefully to evaluate your level of understanding and the quality of your work for this class. Therefore, it is very important that you clean up and document your source code so others can understand it easily: <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span></p><ul><li>As much as possible, make your source code self-documenting and easily modifiable. <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">For example, if you are setting a flag, it is better to write code such as: <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span></p><pre>MYFLAGSET   EQU   1
<span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span>MYFLAGRESET EQU   0
<span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span>&lt;....&gt;
<span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span>         ld    a,MYFLAGSET
<span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span>         ld    [myFlagVar],a </pre><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><p class="line862">than the equivalent code, which is not self-documenting: <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span></p><pre>         ld    a,1
<span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span>         ld    [myFlagVar],a </pre><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span></li><li>choose good variable names. There should be an obvious correlation between a variable's name and its function. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span></li></ul></li><li><p class="line862">if a function is more than a few lines and isn't completely obvious, you should provide header information to the function right before the source code of the function itself. Look at my source code libraries, such as bigsprite.asm for good examples of this. In general, a good template is: <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span></p><pre>;***************************************************************************
<span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span>;* &lt;put name of function here&gt;
<span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span>;* &lt;put description of function here. Take as many lines as you need&gt;
<span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span>;* input:
<span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span>;*   &lt;describe here what registers or parameters the function takes as input&gt;
<span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span>;*   &lt;use a new line for each register or parameter&gt;
<span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span>;* output:
<span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span>;*   &lt;describe here what registers or parameters the function takes as output&gt;

<span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span>;* destroys:
<span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span>;*   &lt;list here any registers (other than the output register(s)) whose values are destroyed in the function&gt;
