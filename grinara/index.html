<p><h3> Overview </h3></p>
<p> 

This is just a page to hold random resources related to the Gameboy.  I collect
odd Gameboy hardware and like to know how it works, so here you'll find some
scans and datasheets or whatever.  Right now it has some info on the <a
href="#sharkmx">Interact Shark MX</a>, the <a href="#gshark">Interact Game
Shark Pro</a> and the <a href="madcatzhtml.html">Mad Catz Camera Link</a>. 

</p>

<p>
Update - no update really, just to keep site alive on this site.  Perhaps I need another update?
</p>


<a name="sharkmx"><p><h3> Interact Shark MX </h3></p>
<p>

I found the 
<a href="http://www.interact-acc.com/">Interact</a>
Shark MX at a local software store, never heard of it before.  The
Shark MX is a specially designed gameboy cart that has a modem and software
that lets you send and receive email, along with organizer functions.  Probably
annoying to use.  However, I had to know more about it, so I picked one up on
markdown for around $17 USD.  I'm guessing they'll end up on clearance
next to all the Gameboy Cameras soon.

</p>
<p>

The Shark MX is made by 
<a href="http://www.datel.co.uk/">Datel</a>
like other Interact products like the Game Shark, etc.  It's sold in .uk as
"Mail Junkies World Port".  

</p>
<p>

Opening the Shark MX is easy, its case just snaps together, none of the
security screws that Nintendo carts have.  Inside is a board with a few <a
href="chips.txt">chips</a> and components on it along with a phone and gameboy
cart connector.  One of the chips is a custom Datel MBC which isn't
compatible with any of the Nintendo MBC's.  

The only memory onboard is a 2mbit 
<a href="http://www.ssti.com/">SST</a> 39SF020 flash eeprom, which stores both code and data.  


Also onboard is a 
<a href="http://www.silabs.com/">Silicon Labs</a> 2400 baud 
<a href="http://www.silabs.com/products/isomodem.asp">Si2400 ISOmodem</a>
chipset.

</p>
<p>

Here's some pix of the Shark MX: <br>

</p>
<p>

One interesting thing about the Shark MX is that it replaces the original gameboy startup logo with a GB-MAIL logo.   

<br>It replaces <img src="nin.gif" alt="the Nintendo(tm) logo"> with <img src="gb-mail.gif" alt="the gb-mail logo">.




</p>

<a name="gshark"><p><h3>Interact Game Shark Pro</h3></p>
<p>

The Interact Game Shark Pro for Gameboy is a cheat device that lets you
modify the way games work by insterting itself, physically and electrically between the Gameboy and the cart being played.  It comes with a PC cable with a Gameboy link connector on one end and a parallel port connector on the other.

</p>
<p>

Opening the Game Shark reveals a circuit board with three <a href="gshark/chips.txt">chips</a>, a male and female gameboy card connector, an on-off switch and
a momentary pushbutton. </a>
<p>

The interesting thing about the cable is that it is a commercially available
means to connect a Gameboy to your PC.  The only other known cable is the <a
href="#madcatz">Mad Catz Camera Link</a> which is pretty much usable only for
its intended purpose.  Here is the <a href="gshark/shark2pp.gif">pinout and
wiring information</a> for the Game Shark cable. 

</p>
<a name="madcatz"><p><h3>Mad Catz Camera Link</h3></p>
<p>

This cable is made by <a href="http://www.madcatz.com/gameboy.html">Mad Catz,
Inc.</a> and has a Gameboy link connector on one end and a parallel port
connector on the other.  It is designed to interface with the Gameboy Camera
cart and comes with included software for this.  It works by simulating the
Gameboy Printer with a PIC chip inside the parallel connector shell.  It
doesn't do a particularly good job at that so it pretty much only works with
the Gameboy Camera.  For those interested in the protocol, check out <a
href="madcatz.txt">madcatz.txt</a> and <a href="madcatz.c">madcatz.c</a>.


</p>

<p><h3>Software</h3></p>
<p>

<a href="gbtmx01.zip">GBTMX V0.01</a> - This
is a version of GBT for Bung XChanger to allow it to read from and write to the
Shark MX's flash eeprom.  Its a quick hack, use it only on the Shark MX, it
most likely will fail on other carts so use the normal GBT for them.   Note
that using this tool overwrites the data on the cart, effectively destroying
all data.  Backing up original cart data is strongly recommended. <a
href="Gbtmx01.c">C Source</a> 

</p>
<p>

<a href="gbtgs01.zip">GBTGS V0.01</a> - This
is a version of GBT for Bung XChanger to allow it to read from and write to the
Game Shark V3.1 cart.  Again, use it only on the Game Shark cart, use the
normal GBT for all other purposes.  Note that using this tool overwrites data
on the cart, most likely making the cart useless in the process (unless you're
restoring a backed-up image.)  Note there are other versions of the Game Shark,
most likely very different in implementation. This was written with the
hardware version 3.1 in mind and most likely will not back up other versions
correctly.  (My cart has "ACTION REPLAY V4.01" for the software revision.) <a
href="gbtgs01.c">C Source</a>

</p>
<p>
<a href="gsterm17.zip">GSTERM V1.7</a> - This is a modified version of Jeff Frohwein's GBTerminal for communicating with his GB-BASIC cart.  This version works with the Interact Game Shark Pro cable instead of Jeff's GB-to-PC cable.  C source included.
