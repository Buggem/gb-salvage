Do NOT take your Cybiko apart & play with the LCD !

 In my quest to figure out how the cybiko LCD screen
interfaces to the main circuit board, I disassembled
my unit completely. I Then attempted to pry the LCD
loose from the board it was mounted on. It was held
in place by two small plastic "hooks." Once these
hooks gave way, the LCD cable was extended beyond
it's ability to safely flex. The result? THE DISPLAY
NO LONGER WORKS! Ugh... Now I've got a totally useless
cybiko. Well.. maybe not totally useless. I might
can use it for a CyWIG setup on the PC side because
everything else still works.

 The plus side of all of this is that I was able to
locate the part number for the LCD display chip that
was otherwise hidden under the cable itself. The
actual display chip is mounted on the flexible LCD
cable and is a Hitachi HD66421 part. It has internal
display RAM and handles the complex LCD display signals
necessary to update the LCD itself. Here are various
web links that offer more information on this part:
