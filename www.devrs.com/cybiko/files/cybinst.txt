 [If you want to send comments or bug reports email
  them to CyBuilder@hotmail.com. Due to the volume
  of mail I get, I can not reply to most of them.
  Get the latest version from:
    http://www.devrs.com/Cybiko ]
   NOTE: IF YOU POST THIS GAME ON YOUR WEB PAGE YOU
   MUST POST A LINK TO THE WEB ADDRESS ABOVE SOMEWHERE
   ON YOUR WEB SITE.


0)  Please note that these instructions DO NOT WORK for
   boot logos. For these, you need to use these instructions
   instead:  http://www.devrs.com/cybiko/files/logoinst.txt

1)  First, download and install CyberLoad v1.16 build 121,
   or later, if you have an older version than this.

2)  Download the game or application and save it in your
   "CyberLoad\local_files\user_files" folder. The complete
   file path name will probably be the following:

     c:\Program Files\Cybiko\CyberLoad\local_files\user_files

    From now on, the game or application will just be referred
   to as "the app".

3)  If the app has a file name which ends with .app, then go to
   step 5.

4)  If the app has a file name which ends with .zip, then you
   need to UnZip this file using WinZip or some similar program.
   If you do not see WinZip installed on your computer then go to
   http://www.winzip.com and download their evaluation copy.
   Install it and then use it to UnZip the app. You should now
   see an app file name the ends with .app.

    [NOTE: The reason many files are Zipped it makes their file
     size smaller AND Netscape users often have problems
     downloading file names that end with .app ]

5)  Turn on your Cybiko and then connect the PC-to-Cybiko cable
   to one of your serial ports on the computer.

6)  Start up CyberLoad.

7)  Look for the "MyComputer" box on the left side of the
   CyberLoad window. If there is a + on the left of the text
   "My Computer" then click on the +. This will show you a -
   and "User Files". If there is a + to the left of "User Files"
   then click on it. This will show you a - and all of the
   games/apps in the "CyberLoad\local_files\user_files" folder.

8)  Select the app under "User Files" and transfer it to the Cybiko.

9)  All Done!
