SDK Console Problems v1.01023 by Jeff F.
---------------------------------------

 The Console in the SDK is used to send unofficial games/apps to the Cybiko.
These are solutions for those that can't get the SDK Console to send a file
to their Cybiko. (i.e. When you select Send File, nothing happens.)

**********************************************************************
* NOTICE: With CyberLoad v1.16 build 121 (and later versions) you no *
* longer need to use the SDK Console to send unofficial games/apps   *
* to the Cybiko. (FOR BOOT LOGO'S YOU YOU MUST USE SDK CONSOLE.)     *
* Copy these games/apps to the "CyberLoad\local_files\user_files"    *
* folder. The complete folder path is usually:                       *
*     c:\Program Files\Cybiko\CyberLoad\local_files\user_files       *
* You can use Windows explorer to drap and drop unofficial games/apps*
* into this folder. (NOTE: The game file name must end with .app     *
* If the game/app file name ends with .zip then you must first UnZip *
* it. To do that, download WinZip from http://www.winzip.com.)       *
* Restart CyberLoad and it will now show these games/apps. To locate *
* them, start up CyberLoad and look for the "MyComputer" box on the  *
* left side of the CyberLoad windows. If there is a + on the left of *
* text "My Computer" then click on the +. This will show you         *
* "User Files". If there is a + to the left of "User Files" then     *
* click on it. This will show you all of the games/apps in the       *
* "CyberLoad\local_files\user_files" folder.                         *

  1)    Start the SDK Console.
        Open Windows Explorer and drag MyProgram.app
        (Replace MyProgram with the real file name)
        file to the Console window at which time a
        progress dialog is displayed indicating that
        the .app is being transferred to  your Cybiko.

  2)    Run REGEDIT (registry editor) from your
        Start->Run menu. Then do a find for Cybiko.
        Under Cybiko->CyConsole you will find
        Instance0 Instance1, etc... Delete all of them
        and rerun the SDK Console. I don't know why this
        works, but it works perfectly everytime for me.

 3)     Start the console. Click on New.
        This will start a New console.
        Check you COM port setting on the first console.
        Close the first console.
        On the New console set the COM port same as the
        old console. Click on File Send.
