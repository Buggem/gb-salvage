Flash Card Quiz

 This application for cybiko allows you generate your
own Question / Answer quiz. You can either generate
the quiz using "Text Editor & Journal" on the cybiko
(or probably any other cybiko text editor) or you can
generate it on a PC (using windows Notepad) and then
transfer the quiz to the cybiko using CyberLoad.

 When you run this application, the first question is
shown on the screen. You then can press any button to
see both the question and the answer. Pressing any
button at this point will take you to the next question.
The questions will start all over after the last question.

 When you run this application, it reads the questions
and answers from a file 'quiz.txt'. This is the file
that you must generate on the cybiko or on a PC and
transfer it to the cybiko. Here is an example 'quiz.txt':

Question: What is "#" ?
Answer: "#"
5+5#10
4+3#7
2+2#4

 The first line of this file is the template for the
question. The second line is the template for the
answer. The # is used to indicate where to put the
questions and the answers in the template.
 On the third line and all other lines, the # is used
to separate the questions from the answers.

 Questions and answers may be up to 3 lines long. This
is approximately 75 characters or so.

 If you don't wish to use a template for your questions
or answers then just put a # alone on those lines. Example:

#
#
What color are apples?#red
Why ask why?#Good question.
4+4=?#8

 Now... you've got no excuse for failing your chemistry
class test because you didn't have any good way of studying
the periodic element symbols. ;)

    !!!TIP!!!
    Copy this demonstration quiz.txt or your own quiz.txt
    file to this directory:

     C:\Program Files\Cybiko\CyberLoad\local_files\user_files

    Now you can use CyberLoad to transfer your quiz.txt to
    your cybiko.

    To install FCQuiz.app application on your cybiko, copy
    it to the same directory shown above and then run
    Cyberload.

    Use WinZip from http://www.winzip.com to convert fcquiz.zip
    to FCQuiz.app.
