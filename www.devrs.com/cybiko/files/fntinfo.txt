Cybiko Fonts File Format v1.0 by Jeff F.
---------------------------------------
 All info from Ernest S. Pazera.

Offset 0x00:  0x01 //indicates this is a font file
Offset 0x01:  charcount //number of characters in the file
Offset 0x02:  maxwidth //maximum width of the characters
Offset 0x03:  maxheight //maximum height of the characters

starting with offset 0x04, and continuing to the end of file are each of
the characters.  each of the character records look like this:

(offsets based on the beginning of the character record)
Offset 0x00: left //left coordinate of the image
Offset 0x01: top //top coordinae of the image
Offset 0x02: width //width of the image
Offset 0x03: height //height of the image

offsets 4 and above are the character bitmap information. a font is
monochrome, and the bits read from msb to lsb, so a typical letter A in 8x8
would look like:

00110000=0x30
01111000=0x78
11001100=0xCC
11001100=0xCC
11111100=0xFC
11001100=0xCC
00000000=0x00

so, the character record for this letter would look like:

... 00 00 08 08 30 78 CC CC FC CC 00 ...

from experiments, i've determined that the first character record
corresponds to character 0x20 (the space character).

i have found that 2pic.exe doesnt like too many input files, so using it to
make fonts probably won't work.  

i figure 60 character records should be about the minimum for a font (to
encompass the characters 0x20 through 0x7F and thus getting all of the
ASCII characters). i imagine that cybiko's built in fonts probably go
higher, since they have the (c) character.  i'll have to play around some
more...
