       -----------------------------------

 This circuit allows you to use up to three .GB rom
files (plus menu program and any utilities it contains)
on a single C3 cart. One 512K byte rom image or up to
three 128K byte rom images may be placed on this cart.
These are maximum sizes. Smaller sizes may be substituted.

 In addition to these mods, if the standard 8K byte
cart ram is replaced with a 32K byte chip (connecting
the extra address pins to MBC1 pins 6 & 7) then each
rom image will have it's own 8K save ram and rom image
#2 will even have TWO different 8K save rams in which
to select!

 Only 8Kbytes of RAM are available per rom image even
if a 32K RAM chip is installed and even if only one
rom image is loaded.

 A C3 cart with these mods may be programmed normally
if a single rom image is to be loaded. These mods
appear transparent in this instance.

 In order to put several rom images on a C3 cart a
composite 512K byte rom image should be generated
that is composed of all of the rom images to load.
If this composite rom image is written to a file the
file extension might be .MC1 (for MultiCart type 1)
to distinguish it from a standard .GB format file.
Here is the oranization of a possible composite image:

00000
  ROM Image #1
20000
  Menu Program
40000
  ROM Image #2
60000
  ROM Image #3
80000

 The program used to generate this composite rom image
should also locate the JMP in the first rom image. This
JMP will be located at 100h or 101h. This JMP will be
patched to change the jump location to the cart name
location of the first rom image. The first rom image
cart name will be patched with bank switch code and a
jump to the menu program at 20000. These patches will
allow the Menu program to run first.

 When a menu program is written, it should allow up to
10 seconds for a user to select a rom image to execute.
If none selected in this time then it should execute
the first rom image displayed on the screen. This is
useful for programs such GB Basic that sometimes need
to auto-run on power up.

 The code to actually enable the rom image to be executed
will need to be transfered to GB internal ram since
the menu program code will "disappear" once MBC1
pins 6 and 7 are set to enable rom images #2 or #3.

 It is important that a menu program restore as many
hardware registers as possible to original condition
or else rom images that assume certain values will
not run properly.


Theory of Operation

 When the MBC1 is reset by power up pins 6 and 7 are a
logic low making these mods invisible to normal operation.
Setting pin 6 or 7 (by writing a byte to 4000 after 4MbitROM/
32KbyteRAM mode has been enabled by writing 01 to 6000.)
high forces the upper-half only of the flash to be used by
forcing A18 high. Setting pin 6 high forces A17 high and
setting pin 7 high takes priority over pin 6 and forces A17 low.

| Pin 7 | Pin 6 |      Resulting Action                            |
+-------+-------+--------------------------------------------------+
|   0   |   0   | Mods have no effect (512K Image #1, save RAM #0) |
|   0   |   1   | 128K ROM Image #3 active, save RAM #1            |
|   1   |   0   | 128K ROM Image #2 active, save RAM #2            |
|   1   |   1   | 128K ROM Image #2 active, save RAM #3            |
