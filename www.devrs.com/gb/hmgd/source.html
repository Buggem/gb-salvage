<HEAD><TITLE>Harry Mulder's Gameboy Development: GBTD and GBMB source</TITLE></HEAD>

I am sorry to say that further development for both GBTD and GBMB has been discontinued.
<BR>
<BR>
To accommodate current users of both programs, I have decided to release the source-code for both programs into the
public domain. These can be found on this page.
<BR><BR>
You are free to use these sources for further development, both for personal, business and public aims; so yes, if
you want to make enhancements, and then release those upgraded versions to the public, you have permission to do so.
<BR><BR>
Note that the 'standard' disclaimer for public domain applies; I can not be held responsible for any damage caused by
these sources, in any way. 
<BR><BR>
Reusing these sources will probably require intimate knowledge of Delphi, and can not be regarded as a task for
novice users. Next to that, I will not be able to give help or support while doing this; if you want to try using
these source, you are on your own.
<BR><BR>
As stated, you will need Delphi to compile this source. It was used under Delphi 3, but 4 or 5 will probably also be
possible. The GBTD-Src and GBMB-Src files contain the specific source for the corresponding program. The GBCOMP-Src
zip contains the packages used by both programs; you will need this file in either case.
