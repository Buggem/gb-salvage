<STRONG>The following snippets are available:</STRONG> 
<BR><BR> 
<A HREF="hiscore1.zip" NAME="HiScore">HISCORE1.ZIP:  HiScore version 1 - 3K
(RGBASM Source)</A> 
</P>
<P>This unit helps you in handling those enormously large hi-scores in games.
It defines a new datatype, and the required  functions to use it, so you don't
have to use zilion-bit calculations just to keep track of a score.</P>
<P><BR> 
<A HREF="sgbcp10.zip" NAME="SGBCPASS">SGBCP10.ZIP: SGBCPASS Version 1 - 9K (EXE
&amp; C Source)</A><BR> 
</P>
<P>This executable converts a SGB Color password into actual RGB-values. This
way, you can use the drawing-tools supplied  by the SGB itself to determine
which color palettes to use for your SGB programs. Includes C Source and
password format.</P> 
<P><BR> 
<A HREF="gblc0997.zip" NAME="Gameboy Licencee Codes">GBLC0997.ZIP: Gameboy
Licencee Codes 9/97 - 6K (MS Word Document)</A><BR> 
</P>
<P>This is a list of licencee codes which are stored in bytes [014B] or
[0144/0145] of each Gameboy cartridge. It was  build up by scanning through
ROMs, so there is no real certainty these codes are correct.</P>
<P><BR> 
<A HREF="gb4real1.zip" NAME="GB4Real">GB4REAL1.ZIP:  GB4Real version 1 - 3K
(RGBASM Source)</A> 
</P>
<P>There are some big differences between the emulators and the real Gameboy;
in short, the real thing is a lot messier and  cannot handle certain techniques
which are perfectly valid on the emulators. GB4Real tries to bridge this gap by
cleaning  up and supplying alternatives for things like sprite-handling which
work on both the emulators and the real Gameboy.</P> 
<P><BR> 
<A HREF="kirbyxxl.zip" NAME="Kirby XXL">KIRBYXXL.ZIP:  Kirby XXL - 35K (ROM and
RGBASM source)</A></P>
<P>

<IMG
SRC="kirbyxxl.gif" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="146" BORDER="1" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" ALT="Screenshot from Kirby XXL">
 Kirby XXL shows you how you can set up interrupts in such a way, that different
parts of the screen are handled using  different techniques. It is also a good
example on how to use the <A HREF="supp.html" TARGET="Main Frame">GBTD Library</A>.

<P><BR> 
<A HREF="warwalk1.zip" NAME="Zoomar">WARWALK1.ZIP:  Wario Walking version 1 -
18K (ROM and RGBASM source) 
</A></P>
<P>

<IMG
SRC="warwalk.gif" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="146" BORDER="1" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" ALT="Screenshot from Wario Walking">Wario
Walking shows how you can use the Gameboy video-hardware to get lots of movement
without straining the CPU.  It has two levels of scrolling, a multi-framed Wario
but still needs to be slowed down a lot to make it look nice..</P> 
<P>Note: if you're having trouble implementing GB4Real, you can use this demo
as an example. 
<BR CLEAR="LEFT"> 
</P> 
<P><BR> 
<A HREF="zoomar3.zip" NAME="Zoomar">ZOOMAR3.ZIP:  Zoomar' version 3 - 14K (ROM
and TASM source)</A></P>
<P>

<IMG
SRC="zoomar.gif" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="146" BORDER="1" ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" ALT="Screenshot from Zoomar'">
 Zoomar' was made to see how the Gameboy would handle a worst-case scenario; it
uses real-time zooming, which is very  CPU-intensive as the Gameboy
video-hardware was not designed for tasks like these. So, if you want to see how
that Z80  handles stress, have a look at this demo. 
</P> 
<P>In this package you'll find a pre-compiled ROM, the whole (documented)
source, and yes, it runs on the real Gameboy..  (see the source for more info
about single or multiple frame-mode)
