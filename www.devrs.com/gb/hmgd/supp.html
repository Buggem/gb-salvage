 This application will convert color bitmaps with more than 4 colors to a format
which can be used by Gameboy  Color; it is fully configurable and gives gradual
results, so the longer you wait, the better the quality. It directly outputs to
a GBR file, so you can use GBTD to do the final touchups  and export the picture
to your own format. This tool was not written by me, nor is it stored on my
site; you can get it at

<P>
 Both GBTD and GBMB have a feature called &quot;Auto Update&quot;, through which
changes made in a tileset in GBTD are immediately  reflected in GBMB. This
feature is actually not restricted to my own tools; this document specifies how
this process  works, so that you can make your own tools respond in the same
way.

 This application will convert color bitmaps with more than 4 colors to a format
which can be used by both Gameboy  Color as well as the original Gameboy. It
directly outputs to a GBR file, so you can use GBTD to do the final touchups 
and export the picture to your own format. This tool was not written by me, but

 This helper application for GBTD and GBMB converts &quot;standard&quot; tile &amp;
map-sets to sets containing no reduntant tiles. It  can even optimize using the
flip-settings of the GBC. Next to this, it has some extra goodies which can be
used to change  tile and map-sets. This tool was not written by me, but by
Jeremy Evers. It requires the MFC support library.

 This is a helper application for GBTD; it let's you import fonts from Windows

 WarioCraft demonstrates how to show a GBC full-screen picture using GBTD, GBMB
and GBDK. Although it is C-source, it  gives a detailed explaination of some of
the export-functions of GBTD and GBMB, so it is also an interresting read  for
Assembly-programmers.

 This library has functions which will load tiles generated by GBTD into VRAM.
It can handle compressed or  un-compressed, 4 or 2-color tiles and works
correctly on a real Gameboy. This library requires 
<A HREF="snip.html" TARGET="Main Frame">GB4Real</A>, so download that also if
you do not have it already.
