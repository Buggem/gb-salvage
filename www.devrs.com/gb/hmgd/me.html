<BR>  Computers have come a long way since I started using them. The first one
I used was a TI99/4A; comparing this one to the  PC's currently on the market is
downright silly.

 All this power and space gives us enormous possibilities, but 'pushing the
limits' as a hobby has become quite impossible;  they have almost disappeared,
making squeezing that last cycle out of a chip a full-time job. And even that
joy of  programming is becoming obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to that, due to the enormous variety of hardware, the &quot;overhead&quot;
of making something cute for a PC is rising daily.  It's just no fun making
timer-routines or finding out your demo doesn't run on a VGA-card from
manufacturer X.

 Enter the Gameboy. Here we have a simple system, which is limited by design;
this means that on one hand, it's comparably  easy to make something nice (you
don't need a truck-load of designers, movie-makers, musicians and CD-burners;
the Gameboy  simply can't deliver this power and everybody knows this), while on
the other hand you have to do a lot of joyfull juggling  with power and space to
get everything it can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this the active scene of un-official development and research on this
little beast, and you've got the perfect   platform for fooling around with
hardware..
