This kit for the XM Radio XMPCR allows S/PDIF Digital audio output from your XMPCR
without requiring ANY soldering or cutting of the XMPCR case. (The only tool you need to provide is a phillips
screwdriver. [Tip looks like +]) In fact, you get Digital Optical (TOSLINK),
Digital Coax (standard S/PDIF or TTL), and standard Analog output (Line Out),
all working at the same time. (Currently, all of the <a href="OtherPcrMods.pdf">other Digital Output kits</a>
offered on eBay require soldering and cutting holes in the XMPCR case, as shown
in the document in this link.)
<P>
To accomplish this feat, you are provided with a Torx wrench to open
your XMPCR unit, another plastic case (with extra pc board) in which to mount your
XMPCR pc board, and special connectors that connect to your unit without causing
any permanent changes. Wish to later sell your XMPCR in it's original state? No
problem. You can return the XMPCR to its original case, and there are no signs that
it was ever removed from its original case, because the XMPCR was never physically
modified.
<p>
Why provide two kinds of digital outputs? Many high-quality sound cards accept S/PDIF
Digital Coax input, so this may be the preferred format for many. However, the Digital
Optical output may be preferred by those that want true electrical isolation between
their XMPCR and their audio input equipment, or high-end audio cards that only accept
Optical input. Both digital formats provide you with the exact digital signal that
is received from the satellite.
<p>
Note#1: The Coax output provides the standard S/PDIF voltage range. TTL level voltage range
can be provided upon special instruction, for those that have sound cards that require
TTL input.
