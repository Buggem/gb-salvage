<P>

<b>1)</b> First you need to disassemble your XMPCR to remove its pc board. Turn the XMPCR
upside down, on a towel or other cloth, and remove the screws. Use the provided Torx
wrench, shown in the upper left of this photo: <b>(Click on images for larger views.)</b>

<br>
Once you have removed the pc board, reassemble the XMPCR without the pc board.
This part is important so as not to loose any of the original parts.
<p>

<b>2)</b> The provided black box probably already has screws installed in the bottom of
this box. If not, install them now with a phillips screwdriver. Place the 4 nylon
spacers on each screw as shown here:

<p>

<b>3)</b> Place the XMPCR pc board in the box as shown here:

<CENTER><a href="BoxAndBoardLrg.jpg" target=_blank><IMG SRC="BoxAndBoardSml.jpg" WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=240></a></CENTER>

Place a flat washer on each screw. Then apply a nut to each screw but do not tighten them down.
<p>

<b>4)</b> Install the antenna, USB connector, and analog connector as shown:
<CENTER><a href="BoxBoardConnLrg.jpg" target=_blank><IMG SRC="BoxBoardConnSml.jpg" WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=240></a></CENTER>
<br>
Now tighten down the nuts on each screw. Use a nut driver, needle-nose pliers, tweezers, or just your
fingers to tighten them.
<p>

<b>5)</b> Next, <b>REMOVE ALL CABLES FROM THE BOX</b>. Notice on the provided pc board that there
is a diagram that shows the color of each wire, and the position that the wire will connect to
the main XMPCR pc board. This may be helpful if you ever lose this installation manual. Attach
the White wire to pin 9 of the XMPCR board as shown here:

<p>

<b>6)</b> Connect the yellow connector to the next pin (#8) up. Connect Red to #7. Connect Green to #6.
Skip over two pins. Connect Blue to pin #3 and Black to pin #1. Then slide the pc board into the
top slot in the box as shown here:

<br>
<b>MAKE SURE THAT THE BLACK WIRE IS ON PIN #1, AND THE BLUE WIRE IS ON PIN #3. REVERSING THESE WIRES
AND THEN APPLYING POWER COULD PERMANENTLY DESTROY THE XDO ADAPTER KIT.</b>
<p>

<b>7)</b> Apply the extra clear bumper over the center of the front panel LED hole. Then
gently press the LED into the front panel hole until it is even with the front panel and
just touches the bumper as shown here: <b>(MAKE SURE LED WIRES DO NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER WHEN
YOU ARE DONE.)</b>
<CENTER><a href="LEDLrg.jpg" target=_blank><IMG SRC="LEDSml.jpg" WIDTH=240 HEIGHT=240></a></CENTER>
<p>

<b>8)</b> Place the box cover on top and screw it down using the 4 provided black screws.
Flip over the box and then apply a rubber bumper to each corner of the box. The bumpers
are shown here in the middle of the box before installation:

<p>

<b>9)</b> Flip over your box, install cables, and try out your new Digital Output kit! Launch your XM Radio
software. When your software is up and running, you should see a red glow from the back of the
XDO box. This lets you know that the optical port is working and is ready to be used. :)
