 ARM GCC is probably the ideal, low cost C/C++ compiler
for gp32 dev. It's not the fastest ARM compiler available,
but it is free. Here is v1.1 of a crt0.S and lnkscript
that I wrote for gcc for the gp32

  http://www.devrs.com/gp32/files/gcc/

 It is designed to work with ported official libs or with a
setup that uses no official libs.

1) Make a directory for installation of this gcc package.
  For this example, we will use c:\bin\gcc304 but this
  will be reference below as %rootdir%\gcc304

2) Get FireFly's GCC 3.0.4 port from here and unzip it
  in the directory we just created:

    http://darkfader.net/gp32

   This is a generic ARM C/C++ compiler for windows. It is
  optimized for ARM9 by default.

3) Copy the file arm-elf-objcopy.exe from directory:
     %rootdir%\gcc304\bin
   to the following directory:
     %rootdir%\gcc304\arm-elf\bin
   Now rename the new copied file to the following:
     objcopy.exe

   This will make it easier later when we are compiling files.

4) From here http://www.devrs.com/gp32/files/gcc/libs/ get the
  following files:
    crt0.o crtbegin.o crtend.o user_init.o
  and put them into the following directory:
    %rootdir%\gcc304\arm-elf\lib\gcc-lib

5) Now install the official libs that have been ported to gcc.
  These are all the files from http://www.devrs.com/gp32/files/gcc/libs/
  that have the following format: lib*.a

   I prefer to install these in c:\bin\gp32lib as a central location
  so that I can use multiple C compilers, for testing code on each
  compiler. However, if you only plan to use one C compiler, you may be
  successful by copying them to the following directory:
    %rootdir%\gcc304\arm-elf\lib\gcc-lib

6) Using a text editor (windows NOTEPAD will work) modify your
  autoexec.bat file to contain the following line. Putting it at the
  bottom of the file will work:
    SET PATH=%rootdir\gcc304\arm-elf\bin;%PATH%
  (REPLACE %rootdir% WITH YOUR ACTUAL PATH NAME!!)
  Save the file & exit text editor.
 
7) Reboot your computer so the autoexec.bat changes will take effect.

8) Get one of the example files from http://www.devrs.com/gp32/files/gcc/
  and unzip it in a new folder. Get to a command line interface (open a
  DOS window if using win95/win98) and type the command MAKE to compile
  the example.
