.gxe - Binary info file : title, company, icon, encrypted stuff, ...

.gxc - Encrypted binary file. Usually only the first X bytes of a
       commercial gxc is encrypted. The percentage of the file that
       is encrypted is controlled by the encryption program. (But
       often it is a very low percentage.) Here is the format

       Header (20 bytes long)
       Encypted binary data (X% of file)
       Unencrypted binary data (100-X% of file)

       If you remove the 20 byte header and unencrypt the file, then the
       resulting data is identical in all other respects with a .gxb file.
       
.gxb - Non-encrypted binary file. This is placed in gp32 ram starting
       at location 0xc000000. The entry point is the starting location
       and the entry is performed in ARM (not thumb) mode. Here is the
       header format:

        DCD End Of Rom Code(?)
