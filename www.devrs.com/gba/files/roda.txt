ObjCopyRoda.EXE
---------------

 Here is a version of GCC objcopy for Windows that when importing
binary files & exporting object files, the exported section is
.roda instead of .data. This allows you to easily assign binary
data to be put into ROM rather than into RAM.

 Ideally, the exported section probably should be .rodata but
this version of objcopy was hacked rather than recompiled and
there was only room for 4 characters. To have .roda sections
included in .rodata (read-only data/ROM) sections you need to
make the following modifications to your "lnkscript" file.

Change this part:

  .rodata    :
  {
    *(.rodata)
    *(.rodata.*)
    *(.gnu.linkonce.r*)
  }


to this, instead, so that .roda data goes into .rodata data section:

  .rodata    :
  {
    *(.rodata .roda)
    *(.rodata.*)
    *(.gnu.linkonce.r*)
  }

That's all there is to it.
