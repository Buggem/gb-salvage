Comparing various ARM C Compilers
(In ARM mode, not Thumb mode)
-----------------------------

   info from David Welch

Well here are the Dhrystone results to date, this is prolly as much as I am
going to do.  It appears that -O2 (full optimizations) is the default for
the ARM tools, gh and gcc showed great improvements when optimizations were
turned on.  The -Otime option was not listed when running the armcc program
on the command line you have to RTFM.  gcc and gh seem to be tied and at
best get to 1.8 times slower than arms best.

Oh yeah, maybe I will have to do this again with the cache on! 

arm/ads         168282 clocks   no optimizations (cannot recreate this one
we think its ads 1.0)

arm/ads1.1      188516 clocks   no optimizations
arm/ads1.1      188516 clocks   -O2 
arm/ads1.1      151953 clocks   -Otime

arm/sdt         182109 clocks   no optimizations
arm/sdt         182109 clocks   -O2 (full) optimizations
arm/sdt         185625 clocks   -O1 
arm/sdt         211953 clocks   -O0 
arm/sdt         167109 clocks   -Otime

gh              453126 clocks   no optimizations
gh              305001 clocks   -O optmizations
gh              506797 clocks   -OLAMISD (all optimizations)
gh              269610 clocks   -OLAMID (almost all) very respectable!!!

gcc             259766 clocks   -O3 optimizations
gcc             266094 clocks   -O2 optimizations
gcc             265704 clocks   -O1 optimizations
gcc             458673 clocks   no optimizations
