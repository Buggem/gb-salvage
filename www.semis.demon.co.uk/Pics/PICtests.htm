PPWIN Hardware Testing and Problems</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>Start by testing your programmer with the printer connector
and PIC removed. Apply power to the programmer, ideally using a current
limited power supply (100mA) or with a 100R resistor in series with VIN.
The resistor acts a bit like a fuse is it will quickly burn out if there
is a serious problem but should provide enough current to power the programmer
if it's working properly.</font>
<p><font size=+1><font color="#FF6666">1) </font><font color="#000000">Both
the VCC and VPP LED's should be on. </font>Using a Voltmeter measure the
Voltage between Pin5 (0V) and Pin14 (5V) on the 18pin PIC socket. This
comes through a ZTX500 transistor from the 78L05 regulator so if it's not
5V check the Voltages on the regulators input and output. If the output
Voltage is too high it could be the wrong way around or the wrong device.
If the output Voltage is to low you could have a short on the PCB or one
of the electrolytics may be upside down. If the voltage out of the regulator
is about right but the Voltage on Pin14 is to low then check the transistor
is the correct device and the right way around. If this is right then see
if Pin8 of the 7406 is nearly 0V as this drives the transistor on.</font>
<p><font size=+1><font color="#FF6666">2) </font>Next measure the Voltage
between Pin5 (0V) and Pin4 (13.2V) of the 18pin PIC socket. This should
be between 13 to 13.5V, similar possible problems to 1) but also the output
Voltage could be too high if the 1N4148 diodes are the wrong way around.</font>
<p><font size=+1><font color="#FF6666">3) </font><font color="#000000">If
both 5V and 13V supplies are now correct both LED's should be ON if not
check they are the correct way around and the drive resistors are the correct
value.</font></font>
<p><font size=+1><font color="#FF6666">4) </font><font color="#000000">Remove
the 100R resistor and connect to the printer port, run the ICPROG software
following the settings given in the software section. Use the hardware
check to make sure you can turn VCC/VDD (MCLRE) ON/OFF through software.
Also make sure that when Data Out is ticked the Data In input&nbsp; becomes
ticked.</font></font>
