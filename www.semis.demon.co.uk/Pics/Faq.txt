How do I go about developing some pic84 code
----------------------------------------------

Q1. What is involved in developing and programming a pic84 ?

A1. Follow these steps,

1) Have a look at my demo file (PPTEST.ASM). Then write your assembler file 
using DOS edit or PFE (programmers file editor) for windows etc.
Make sure this line is included in your file,

	LIST    P=PIC16C84, F=INHX8M

2) Assemble the file :-

        MPASM FILE.ASM

	you can get a copy of the assembler from my site

3) Then programme the pic using ICPROG

	you must set the hardware as shown on my page
        also make sure the fuse settings are correct



PIC508/509 OSCCAL value
-----------------------

Q2. I am using your software pp875 and the hardware with an UV-erasable 
PIC12c509. If you erase these chips, you loose the calibration word, which 
Microchip programs at address $3FF ?

A2. Read the value out before erasing the chip, and then place it within 
your program code eg:-

   	ORG 0x3FF
	DW <CalibrationWord>

Don't forget to remove it when using a OTP device !


Message: OSCCAL value already programmed
----------------------------------------

Q3.Why do I get "Message: OSCCAL value already programmed" ?

A3. When you are programming a OTP 508/509 the OSCCAL (internal RC 
calibration value) is already programmed into 0x1FF (508) or 0x3FF (509) by
Microchip. Make sure your code does not over write this value. If you get 
this message with an eprom device it's because the chip has not been erased 
properly.


Flash PICS
----------

Q4. I am currently using pic 16C84-04 but find this part is now only 
supplied as a FLASH ROM device (pic 16F84-04) instead of EEprom.
Do you know if modifications are required to the parallel port programmer to 
use this pic ?

A4. I have down loaded the latest PIC16C84 and PIC16F84 programming specs 
from microchip and at first glance they are very similar.

A few timing changes have been made, but nothing drastic.  The configuration 
word now has more 'code protect' features.


Programming I2C EEPROMS
-----------------------

Q5. I'm wondering if your programmer supports I2C (24C0x) chips?

A5. Yes with a simple adapter it is possible to program most I2C EEPROMS
using IC-Prog. Connect the 8 pin EEPROM socket to the 18pin or ISP sockets
as follows,

8pin    18pin   ISP
1       5       GND
2       5       GND
3       5       GND
4       5       GND
5       13      RB7
6       12      RB6
7       ---     ---
8       14      VCC


Protecting PIC12C508/9
----------------------

Q6. Why can I still read my 508 when the protect flag has been set ?

A6. The protection flag on the 508/9 only stops ROM addresses > 0x3F from 
being read (zero). Any data in address range 0-0x3F will read as normal


Getting the transistors
-----------------------

Q7. I have some problems to get the transistor ZTX 500 !  Do you know 
some compatible transistors ???

A7. It's a PNP general purpose device (HFE 100,  IC 100mA) so anything 
that fits should be ok. Try a BC557, BC558, BC640 or 2N3906. Note the BC557, 
BC558, BC640  must be rotated by 180 degress to get the correct pinout.


Multiple pic - parallel programming
-----------------------------------

Q8. Can I plug several pics ontop of each other and programme them all at 
the same time - in parallel.

A8. No you can't programme more than one pic at a time, for many reasons,

The increased power supply current will overload the programmer.
When the programmer verifies the pics it will not be able to 
verify the pics individually - major confusion.
etc...


I can't write any PIC12c508 chips
---------------------------------

Q9. I cant write any PIC12c508 chips.

A9. I always try a PIC16C84 first to test out the hardware. If this is ok 
but the 508 still won't work check the two 1nF filter caps are correct on
the port pins D0/1 and VPP is 13V. Also check the 508 has been fully erased
I find they take a bit longer than other PIC's.

That's it !!!!
