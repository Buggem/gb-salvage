<p><font size=+1>Some uncertainty exists as to the real purpose of the
CLOCK signal - Pin 2 on the GamePack edge connector. It is actually the
processor clock (4.194304 MHz) divided by four (1.048575MHz).&nbsp; However
it serves a much more important role as it indicates when the address and
data lines are stable when interfacing to external IO devices.&nbsp; For
those of you that remember the Motorola 6809 this used to be called the
'E line'.&nbsp; The timing diagram bellow shows that when the Pin 2 is
low the address and data lines are valid.</font>

<p><font size=+1>If the enable of an IO device uses just the Address and
/RD lines and Pin 2 is not included then the device will be frequently
enabled for short periods as the address lines stabilise. In many situations
this may not be a problem but you should be aware of this condition.</font>
