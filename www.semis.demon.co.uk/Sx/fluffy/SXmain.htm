<p><font size=+1>If you're considering a project that need's lots of processing
power but battery consumption isn't a problem then the Scenix SX processors
are for you. Ben's <a href="http://www.codepuppies.com/~ben/sens/pic/sx/">Fluffy
programmer</a> is an ideal starting point if you already have a PIC16C84
programmer.&nbsp; So I have put together some notes on building this programmer
and guidelines if you're familiar with the PIC but your not sure what is
different about the SX.</font>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+3>Building A Programmer</font></font>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Once you have had a look at the
Fluffy programmer home page you will need to build a printed circuit board.&nbsp;
The diagram at the top of the page shows you what it should look like.&nbsp;
Note that my design is for the Centronics port only and I have added 1K
and 1nF filter networks to each input line (D0-D5) to reduce noise with
long leads and changed some of the component values.&nbsp; Ben's original
circuit can also be seen <a href="power.gif">here</a>.</font></font>

<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Shown above is the component overlay
for my Fluffy <a href="scxpcb.bmp">circuit board</a>. Wire the PCB to a
36way Centronics socket using the pinouts shown on the component overlay
(Pin 32 and the ground pins 19 to 29 are different if you use a D25).&nbsp;
You will need to program a PIC16C84HS for the programmer to interface with
the PC so if you don't have one then have a look at my programmer <a href="../../Pics/PICmain.htm">PP875</a>
(no you don't need an SX chip to make this).&nbsp; If you want to make
the programmer look a bit more professional then put it in a box with a
front panel, the finished programmer should look something <a href="sxprog.jpg">like
this</a>.</font></font>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+3>Software</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>To test the programmer use Ben's two test programs these
can be found here in <a href="allnew.zip">allnew.zip (41K)</a>.&nbsp; If
all goes well then you are ready to start programming the SX chips. You
will need the fluffy <a href="flufasm.zip">assembler (32K)</a> which includes
a demo program and&nbsp;<img SRC="new.gif" BORDER=0 height=14 width=31>the
fuse settings for the new SX28A and SX52B parts.</font>
<br><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>A really useful editor for constructing
your code is Programmers File Editor 32bit Win95/8 <a href="../../Apps/pfe101i.zip">PFE
Ver 1.01 (608K)</a>. This is by A.Phillips, you can find the latest updates
at <a href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/people/cpaap/pfe/">PFE home page</a>.
Configure the <a href="sxpfeprg.JPG">'Launch Windows/DOS Application'</a>
button to run the programmer.&nbsp; This is the quickest way I have found
to develop code since you are not constantly hopping between different
applications. You can also configure the <a href="sxpfeasm.JPG">'Execute
DOS' command'</a> button to run the fluffy assembler.</font></font>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+3>Documentation</font></font>
<p><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Two important documents you will
need are the SX18/28 <a href="../../Docs/sx1828old.pdf">data sheet (359K)</a>
and the
<a href="../../Docs/scenixmanualold.pdf">Technical manual (1.3MB)</a>.&nbsp;
Although the data sheet is easier to read I have found a few errors in
it that have been corrected in the technical manual.</font></font>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+3>PIC to SX conversion</font></font>
<p><font size=+1>A common question asked by people familiar with the PIC
series of micro controllers (in particular the 16C84) is what are the main
differences with the SX processor.&nbsp; So after completing a couple of
projects I have listed most of the important differences, I have also appended
a number of common PIC instructions to the Fluffy <a href="Inst.dat">inst.dat</a>
file which you should use, here is the full <a href="Inst.txt">instruction
set</a>.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The page containing the differences is <a href="SXtoPIC.htm">here.</a></font>

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+3>Hardware Problems</font></font>
<p><font size=+1><font color="#FF0000">Interrupts,</font> in theory the
interrupt controller can handle multiple interrupts.&nbsp; But I have found
that if an interrupt occurs before the current one has been cleared (eg:
during the interrupt service routine) the interrupt hardware becomes disabled.&nbsp;
The only way of enabling further interrupts is to clear the WKEN_B register
using the MODE and TRIS commands, problem is were do you do this ?</font>
<p><font size=+1><font color="#FF0000">RTCC,</font> when clocking the RTCC
using the external pin the counter will not count unless the pre-scalar
is used, thus the minimum count is two input pulses.</font>
