This site contains a mixture of electronic hardware and
software development tools which will hopefully prove useful to others.

Many thanks to Chris Lindsay for years of encouragement and to the original 
authors of any material found on this site as they have also put many hours of 
their time into helping others. If you need to contact me you can do so via Email, 
although I will do my best to help, the speed at which I do so will be inversely
proportional to the length of your question.</font>
